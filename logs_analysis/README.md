# Project Summary: #

This project is a internal reporting tool, answering questions about a newspaper
site's user activity, using information from a already established database.
The questions we are concerned with answering are:

  1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
  2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
  3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

# Installation: #  

### Step 1: Installing Required Files ###
___

**Required Programs and OS:**

  * **Windows 10**
  * **Python 3.6.5** - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/
  * **Vagrant 2.1.1** - https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
  * **Git Bash 2.18.0** - https://git-scm.com/download/win

Must have the above programs before moving onto step 2!

<br/>

### Step 2: Readying Database Config ###
___


Once you have downloaded and installed the requirements, we can then download
the preloaded vagrant database configuration using the links below.

**Make sure to extract downloaded files to Desktop!**

<br/>

[FSND-Virtual-Machine](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/April/5acfbfa3_fsnd-virtual-machine/fsnd-virtual-machine.zip)

[newsdata.zip](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/August/57b5f748_newsdata/newsdata.zip)

<br/>

If all goes well, then you should see two additional folders on your desktop:

<br/>

  **1. newsdata-1**  

  **2. FSND-Virtual-Machine**

<br/>

Now, move the file **newsdata.sql** within newsdata folder into the folder
**vagrant** within FSND-Virtual-Machine.  

<br/>

To actually run this project, we will need to have **logs.py**, which is in this
GitHub repository, to be inside folder vagrant as well. Download logs.py and
move it into vagrant.

<br/>

### Step 3: Finish Installation ###
___

If you have finished Step 1 and 2 then on your desktop you should have a folder
called FSND-Virtual-Machine and within it, you should also see a file called
vagrant.  

Go into the vagrant folder and check if you have the files **newsdata.sql** and
**logs.py**.

If both files are in there then you are ready to run the project!

<br/>

# Running the Project: #

### Getting into Linux System ###
___

First, open up Git Bash and then navigate to the folder **vagrant** within
the folder FSND-Virtual-Machine on your Desktop.  

Once you have reached into the folder vagrant, I want you to run the following
commands while waiting in between each operation so they finish:

```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```  

**Note: the command 'vagrant up' will take a while since it is booting up your
linux OS in the virtual environment and command 'vagrant ssh' will allow you to
sign into the OS as a user which then means you can start using the Linux OS**  

<br/>

### Creating the database ###
___

You are almost there! Now that we are in the Linux OS on our shell session,
there is two more commands to run:  

```
cd ../../vagrant  
psql -d news -f newsdata.sql  
```

Running these two commands will build the database this project works with.  

<br/>

### Run the Python File ###
___

Finally, we actually get to see our reports! Now within the Linux OS, we should
still be in the same location.

<br/>

Run the following command:

```
python logs.py  
```

<br/>

If the above gives an error run this command instead:

```
python3 logs.py
```

<br/>

Wait for a little and the reports will come in! A sample report is in the
example_output.txt and its provided within this same repository.
